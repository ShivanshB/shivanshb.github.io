        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        The goal of this project originates with the brilliant Russian photographer, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Prokudin-Gorsky">Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii</a>, who
        travelled across Russia photographing various people, places, and objects. Though this may sound routine, his
        methodology was unique for his time, as he captured his pictures across three—red, green, and blue—color plates.
        These glass plate negatives were purchased by the Library of Congress in 1948, and have recently been digitized.
        In this project, I have reconstructed the various color images through <a
            href="http://boutigny.free.fr/Astronomie/AstroSources/Kuglin-Hines.pdf">phased alignment</a>,
        percentile-based white balancing, and automatic cropping.

        <h2>Initial Approaches</h2>
        <h3>Motivations</h3>
        I started off this project by testing various different approaches to aligning the images. The idea was to see
        which approaches worked best qualitatively (clearest images, least artifacts) and quantitatively (how long it
        took to align the images). Since many of these initial approaches were based on a window-search algorithm, they
        were too slow to run on the .tif files and thus these initial tests were constrained to the .jpg files. The
        purpose of these tests was to determine the best initial method onto which I would add improvements. <br> <br>


        <h3>Implementations</h3>
        Out of the methods depicted below, L2 and NCC are as defined on the project spec, kernel is a convolution based
        approach using <code>scipy.signal.correlate2d</code> and SSIM is used from
        <code>skimage.metrics.structural_similarity</code>. Lastly, the phase based alignment method was implemented by
        hand, and is further detailed in the <a href="#bells-whistles">Bells & Whistles section</a>.


        <h3>Observations</h3>
        We notice that although most of the methods converge to very similar offsets for the red and green channels,
        they do so at various speeds and with varying accuracy. For example, the kernel based method converges far
        slower than the others and very often disagrees with the majority (and produces a slightly more blurry output).
        On the other hand, the custom phase-based method runs multiple orders of magnitude faster than the other methods
        and consistently provides the clearest images. As such, this phase based alignment method was chosen for further
        iteration and improvement. The details of this implementation can be found in my code and will be discussed in
        the <a href="#bells-whistles">Bells & Whistles section</a>.

        <h2>Improvements and Pipelining</h2>

        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        It is important to note that these alignment techniques work more robustly when the images are cropped, since
        metrics such as NCC are not robust to borders and other image artifacts. An example of this is seen below, since
        the L2 and NCC alignment techniques produce slightly blurry photos when the images are not cropped. In this
        case, the images had 10% cropped off of each side. It is
        also important to note that our phase based alignment method seems to be robust to these artifacts, further
        making it the obvious choice to proceed with.

        <h3>General Pipeline</h3>
        Now that we have identified our optimal alignment approach, we can sketch out the pipeline we will use to
        generate the cleanest, crispest possible images.

        <ol>
            <li>Splitting the image into three channels. This is done through simple array slicing. We proceed by
                aligning both the red and green channels to the blue channel.</li>
            <li>Image-pyramid based alignment. We use our phase-alignment method to recursively align the larger .tif
                images, providing a large speedup without any drop in alignment accuracy or image quality.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>The image is halved in both dimensions 4 times to give us our lowest resolution image. Since
                        most of the larger .tif images are 4000px x 10000px the size of this image is about 250px x
                        625px.</li>
                    <li>An exhaustive window search is performed on this lower resolution, image from the offsets of
                        [-16, +16]</li>
                    <li>As the alignments propogate recursively upwards, we begin to test the displacements at higher
                        resolutions. Though we are still using a sliding window approach, we now only examine
                        displacements in the window [-2, +2]. Notice that these displacements are centered at the
                        optimal alignments found at the lower resolutions.</li>
                    <li> This method allows for a much larger search window to be covered with far less computation,
                        providing the necessary speedup to make the .tif files tractable.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Automatic cropping is performed by thresholding row and column values to remove rows and columns that
                are outliers w.r.t their neighbors or almost entirely white or black pixels. This will be expanded upon
                in the <a href="#bells-whistles">Bells & Whistles section</a>.</li>
            <li>Percentile based white balancing recolorizes the images into a more photo-realistic space. This will be
                expanded upon in the <a href="#bells-whistles">Bells & Whistles section</a>. </li>

        <h3>Phase-Based Alignment</h3>
        The fastest, most robust alignment technique for me ended up being phased based alignment, which was derived in
        a paper titled, <a href="http://boutigny.free.fr/Astronomie/AstroSources/Kuglin-Hines.pdf">"The Phase
            Correlation Alignment Method" by C. D. Kuglin D. C. Hines</a>.

        <br> <br> This technique works generally by first converting both images from the spatial domain to the
        frequency domain using a 2-dimensional FFT. It then computes the cross-power spectrum which works to identify
        common frequencies between the images. These results are them normalized and taken back to the frequency domain,
        directly providing a shift. <br> <br> The intuition for this is that if one image is a "shifted" version of
        another, this
        shift will be depicted as a "peak" in the final result. Since this technique operates in the frequency domain,
        we circumvent having to test a polynomial number of offsets and allow ourselves to compute the optimal shift in
        constant time regardless of the underlying shift. It is also important to note that operating in the frequency
        domain grants us additional robustness to artifacts such as borders.

        <h3>Automatic Cropping</h3>

        Automatic cropping was implemented through a relatively simple procedure. We used thresholding to identify rows
        and columns that were either almost completely white or black and remove them from the image. Analyzing
        histograms helped me empirically determine the thresholding interval [0.05, 0.95].

        Results from this cropping on a handful of images are shown below.

        <h3>Percentile-Based White Balancing</h3>

        My percentile-based white balancing approach has a few main components. First, we split the image into its three
        channels and identify the 5th an 95th percentiles of vales. We then ignore the values outside this interval and
        stretch the remaining values to fill the [0, 1] interval for float images. Intuitively, we are ignoring the
        darkest and brighest pixels and taking what was the most "normal bright" and making it correspond to the color
        white. This is done separately across channels to allow for more degrees of freedom for the image to remain
        completely balanced. Empirically, this produces a more photo-realistic version of the images as can be seen
        below.
